Several solutions exist to address this issue, depending on your specific needs and project setup.  One common approach is to modify your PurgeCSS configuration to include more aggressive selectors, potentially picking up dynamically-added classes. This might result in slightly larger bundles (due to including some extra rules), but typically won't be as significant as the impact of significantly larger bundles caused by including lots of unused styles from conditionally-rendered elements.  Another approach is to manually extract dynamic classes that are conditionally added and include them in the main CSS file, ensuring PurgeCSS can detect them.

Here's an example of adjusting the PurgeCSS configuration in your `tailwind.config.js` (or similar config file for your framework):
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    // Add more aggressive content options if necessary
    './node_modules/@themesberg/flowbite/**/*.js' //Example
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  purge: {
    content: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'],
    options: {
      safelist: ['bg-red-500', 'p-4'], // Add your dynamically added classes here!
       // You may need to add other safelist entries
    }
  }
};
```
By adding `'bg-red-500', 'p-4'` to the `safelist`, we explicitly tell PurgeCSS to keep those classes, regardless of whether they appear in the statically analyzed content. Remember that this solution isn't perfect and might increase bundle size. In a production-ready app, it would need more refinement. More complex solutions might involve using a separate CSS extraction tool or a different approach for managing your Tailwind CSS integration.
