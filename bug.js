This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The problem is that Tailwind's purge functionality may not correctly remove unused styles when the styles are dynamically generated during the client-side hydration process. This leads to unnecessary CSS being included in the final bundle, increasing the page load time. For example:
```javascript
//pages/index.js (Next.js)
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowComponent(true)}>Show Component</button>
      {showComponent && (
        <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
          <p>This component is dynamically shown.</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
The `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes might not be purged because they are only applied conditionally during client-side hydration.
